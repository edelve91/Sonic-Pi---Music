# Sonic-Pi---Music

In these notes I will put some code written in Sonic Pi.

## Creativity = {:Mathematical Music Theory => Computer Application }



>One of the goals of mathematical music theory is to anchor in the beautiful port of computational application. 
>So it's good for intuitive (maybe not >:) composition or analysis on a giant set of musical data. 
>Then, this cycle is fed back in the appearance of new music and, therefore, in new theory.
